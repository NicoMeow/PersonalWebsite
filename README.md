# PersonalWebsite
It is a single-page portfolio website where I display photos, blog posts and links to my projects. In the future, I might add more content sections and features that would make sense for websites of such type. It is meant to be easily extended and scaled and the design should remain straightforward and minimalistic. 
# Motivation
The goal for one is to create a customized space to display my work, but also to play around with bits and pieces of knowlege I learnt about developing web apps. At school and at work I would be working on a specific parts projects and therefore learn about a specific part of a technology stack. For this project I wanted to touch upon every aspect of the process from design to implementation to deployment.
So throughout the process, I constantly reminded myself to stick to the original design I drew up on a piece of paper, and to only include additional libraries unless absolutely necessary. There was a tendency to change up the designs for a easier solution, or rely on somebody else's code when things don't work. This approach helped me develop a deeper understanding of the fundamentals and push through obstacles. Moving forward as I learn more about development, I would continuously update the project for better code quality and performance.
